## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Something that I have always struggled on is letting an image be shown when on the website, because it's different when I need to do it on my local computer. I also used SCSS for only the second time, but the first time was mainly copying and pasting from a website I used only CSS with.


```html
  <div class="card__picture">
    <div class="card__overlay"></div>
  </div>
```

When live.
```css
.card__picture {
  background-image: url(./../../dist/images/image-header-mobile.jpg);
}
```
When on my computer
```css
.card__picture {
  background-image: url(./../dist/images/image-header-mobile.jpg);
}
```

Besides that I learned how to use grid. Below are a few examples I used.
```css
body {
  display: -ms-grid;
  display: grid;
}

.card {
  display: -ms-grid;
  display: grid;
  -ms-grid-columns: (1fr)[1];
      grid-template-columns: repeat(1, 1fr);
```

### Continued development

I definitely still want to focus more of my time with using grid, but also trying to figure out when it is better to use grid vs. flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - This was a great resource when trying to learn about 'Grid'. This is a site I use often when wanting to learn something new.

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This website is similar to Mozilla in the format of using it when needing to learn something new.

- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax) - I also got a lot of information from how to set up a lot of my SCSS in a strong way.

## Acknowledgments
My family is the biggest inspiration for me to do these and to grow more as a programmer to make a better life for myself and for them. Besides that [Jessica Chan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoQ6S1a32j8&t=13825s)'s video from [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ) youtube channel was also a large inspiration to not only practice my SCSS but also try a new way of programming by using grid.
